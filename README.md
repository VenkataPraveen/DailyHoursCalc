Hours Calculation
In the dist:

https://github.com/VenkataPraveen/DailyHoursCalc/blob/main/DailyHoursCacl/dist/English_DailyHoursCalc.exe

I have an exe which does the same thing what the python does

What this script does?

It calculates the login time and logout time and calculates the total number of work hours
if the total number of hours worked is greater than 6 or 9 hours. If it is, the script calculates the required break time and subtracts it from the total number of hours worked
